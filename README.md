Project Introduction 
The primary objective of this project is to train a model that can identify marine animal species from a dataset of images and determine whether they belong to the endangered or extinct population. This system aims to assist wildlife researchers, photographers, and conservationists in quickly and efficiently identifying species and assessing their conservation status. By doing so, it seeks to support efforts in protecting and preserving endangered animals.

As humans, we share this planet with a diverse range of animals that have existed long before us, inhabiting every corner of the Earth. Unfortunately, many of these species are suffering due to human activities, including climate change, habitat destruction, and other environmental impacts. These issues threaten not only their survival but also the ecological balance of our planet.

It is our responsibility to take action in conserving these animals. This project is designed to aid in those efforts by providing an accessible and effective tool for identifying and supporting the protection of endangered species.
